Mark's git notes ~



Working Directory: code local to my computer
git add *

Index: staging area for code to be pushed from
git commit -m "your message here"

Head: make your changes available to others
git push origin <branch>



Make new branch and move to it:
git checkout -b <branch>

Switch back to master:
get checkout master

Delete a branch:
git branch -d <branch>



Update local repository to latest commit:
git pull

Merge a branch into your active branch:
git merge <branch>

Look at branch differences:
git diff <source_branch> <target_branch>

See git history:
git log



Made a mistake? Replace your working directory with latest content in Head with:
git checkout -- <filename>

-rw-r--r--
